1. How to Connect to the Backend API
In the JavaScript code above, the <API_GATEWAY_ENDPOINT> is a placeholder for your actual API Gateway endpoint. You'll replace it with the endpoint where your Lambda function is hosted, which will interact with DynamoDB and return the list of nearby mechanics.

For example:

javascript
Copy code
const response = await fetch('https://abc123xyz.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/prod/mechanics', {
How to Host the HTML/JS Files
Static Website Hosting with S3: You can use Amazon S3 to host your HTML/JS files. Here's how:

Upload the index.html, script.js, and styles.css files to an S3 bucket.
Enable static website hosting on the S3 bucket.
Set the correct permissions for the S3 bucket so users can access the files.
CloudFront for CDN: Optionally, you can use Amazon CloudFront to distribute the static content globally with low latency.

Domain Setup (Optional): If you have a domain (e.g., mechanicfinder.com), you can use Amazon Route 53 to route traffic to your S3 bucket or CloudFront distribution.

Conclusion
This simple frontend will allow users to interact with your "Find Nearest Mechanic" application, providing them with the option to either manually enter their location or let the browser automatically detect it via geolocation. The results are then fetched from the backend API (hosted via AWS Lambda and API Gateway) and displayed to the user in a clean, easy-to-read list.

You can name the application "Mechanic Finder" or any of the suggestions above, depending on the branding you'd like to go for. This basic frontend setup is also scalable and can be extended with more advanced features as needed.
